Code for generating artificial SNN data in Brian, used for benchmarking FC inference algorithms.

For setting up environment run:
```
conda create --name fc-brian
conda activate fc-brian

conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge brian2
conda install -c conda-forge networkx

```

To speed up simulations Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required.
